xmsg for ekg2
(C) 2006 Michał Górny
===========================================================

Some time ago I was looking for some easy way to send messages to my ekg2 from
external scripts. I haven't found any useful methods to do this. Maybe I could
use rc plugin some way, but it'd be pain-in-the-ass, I think. So I decided to
create small plugin for doing this.

I thought about several ways of delivering messages to the plugin, but finally
decided to use filesystem for this. xmsg watches directory specified by user,
fetches any file created there and shows it to user as a message.

All of this is done by use of xmsg: sessions. To start watching some directory,
at first You should create session, with path to that directory as UID. Then
connect fresh-made session and watch the magic.

When session is connected, xmsg parses all files currently existing in given
directory. If possible, then it uses inotify to immediately fetch newly-created
files. Even if inotify is not available (kernel <= 2.6.13, for example), it can
watch the directory by use of timers.

Variables:
	auto_connect
		If set to 1, then ekg2 will automagically connect the session
		on startup. Defaults to 1.
	max_filesize
		The size in bytes, above which files won't be read. Please bear
		in mind, that xmsg mmaps whole file, so this shouldn't be set
		above desired max memory consumption, and above max message
		size. Default to 16 kiB.
	rescan_timer
		Interval of rescanning given directory. No need for this when
		using inotify. Defaults to 0, if inotify is available, or 300.
	send_cmd
		See SENDING MESSAGES below.

Some remarks:
* session UIDs should be in form 'xmsg:/some/path', without trailing slash
  (but existence of that slash shouldn't also make any problems),
* xmsg does watch only given directory, it DOES NOT watch its' subdirectories,
* the sender of xmsg messages is 'xmsg:filename', but the filename is cut
  before first colon (that's feature, not bug), so I recommend to use filenames
  like: 'somesource:XXXXXX' (mktemp-like syntax),
* logs plugin currently has problems with slashes in UIDs, so xmsg messages
  won't be logged,
* all fetched files are immediately removed (but only if read successfully),
* message files shouldn't be created directly in watched directory; although
  inotify waits until file is closed, the plugin can't fully determine if
  someone isn't still writing to it — so it's better to create it somewhere else
  first, then only move to watched directory.

EXAMPLE OF USE

/usr/local/bin/smbxmsg:
	#!/bin/bash
	[ -z "$1" ] && exit 1
	[ -z "$2" ] && exit 1
	[ ! -f "$2" ] && exit 2
	[ "`stat -c %U "$2"`" != "smbguest" ] && exit 3
	
	N=`mktemp -u /some/path/smbmsg-$1:XXXXXX`
	
	chown myuser:mygroup "$2"
	mv "$2" "$N"

/etc/samba/smb.conf:
	[...]
  	guest account = smbguest
	message command = sudo /usr/local/bin/smbxmsg "%f" %s
	[...]

/etc/sudoers:
	smbguest ALL=(ALL)      NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/smbxmsg

Then all winpopup messages should be delivered directly to ekg2. Although
smbxmsg takes root privs, it makes sure that owner of given file is smbguest.

SENDING MESSAGES

Starting from 1.9 cvs revision, xmsg is now able to send messages. Message
sending is done by using external handler command, given in send_cmd variable.
When user sends message to xmsg-UID, xmsg saves the whole message in temporary
file, then executes that command with two arguments — UID (without xmsg:)
and path to that file. xmsg DOES NOT unlink message's temporary file after
handler closes, so handler should do it itself.

EXAMPLE HANDLER

/home/myuser/bin/xmsghandler:
	#!/usr/bin/perl
	
	use File::Temp qw/tempfile/;
	
	sub reply
	{
	($fh, $fn) = tempfile("/tmp/$ARGV[0]:XXXXXX");
		print $fh shift;
		close $fh;
		`mv "$fn" "/some/path/"`
	}
	
	exit 1 if (! ($ARGV[0] && $ARGV[1]));
	exit 2 if (! -f $ARGV[1]);
	
	if ($ARGV[0] =~ /^smbmsg-(.*)/) {
		`cat "$ARGV[1]" | smbclient -M "$1"`;
		reply('WinPopup request failed - probably peer is not connected')
			if ($?);
	} else {
		reply('Unknown rcpt - message lost');
	}
	
	unlink $ARGV[1];
	exit 0;

This handler is designed to send winpopup messages with UIDs compatible with
previous example.

(That's all, folks)
