FEW NOTES ABOUT USING SCONS AS EKG2 BUILD SYSTEM


1)	SCons is _alternative_ build system, it is still under development and
	at least currently isn't meant to replace autotools.

2)	SCons uses globs instead of hardcoded lists to determine files to compile,
	so if you're going to place some junk.c in one of source directories (either
	ekg/ or plugins/*/), then please take note SCons will try to compile it
	as standalone object and then link it with resulting binary.

	If you really want to place some *.c files, which you aren't going to
	include, then please surround it with #if 0/#endif. If you're going to
	include it, then please name it *.inc instead.

3)	'Configure' part in SCons is meant to be faster and simpler than autotools
	one — and thus uses less tests. It ain't going to warn you that have
	no/broken compiler or you miss critical dependencies — that's package manager
	work. It is meant to check for things that'd result in enabling or disabling
	some code, plugin or determining C-/LDFLAGS.

4)	SCons doesn't accept some configure-like args. Instead of --with-*=, you
	should specify alternate include/lib paths by using C-/LDFLAGS (-I/-L) or
	specifying C_INCLUDE_PATH & LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

5)	SCons doesn't use many fallbacks like autotools did. If some package
	(e.g. libgadu) is available through pkg-config, then SCons asks pkg-config
	for it. If it couldn't find it, SCons _does not_ search for library with some
	default params. If you install your .pc files in another directory, then
	please set PKG_CONFIG_PATH accordingly.

6)	You really should take a look at scons --help (in main EKG2 sources
	directory) as it lists package-defined options. Among them, there are few you
	might like to twek (PLUGINS especially). If you're going to build EKG2
	package, then you probably would like to set HARDDEPS=1 (and PREFIX=/usr
	probably).

7)	If EKG2 with SCons fails to compile on some OS and it's not your fault
	then please let us know. If SCons does compile some plugin while deps are
	not met (i.e. configure thinks that some dependency is met while it isn't),
	please let us know. If configure says some dep is unmet, while it is met,
	then please first check you have correct version (i.e. gpgme >= 1.0.0).
	Best place to report bugs is http://bugs.ekg2.org/. If it's down, then you
	can find us on !ekg2, ircnet (or me on #jogger.pl, freenode).

8)	SCons does everything what autotools + configure + make was meant to do. You
	don't want to run 'make' after it or './autogen.sh' before it. You just run
	'scons' with correct args, and it does all the hard work. To install compiled
	files in system directories, use 'scons install'. You may also like to supply
	DESTDIR= option to it. To clean up, use 'scons -c'. To uninstall, use
	'scons -c install'.
